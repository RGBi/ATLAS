# ATLAS
Application for Terrestrial LAser Scanning (ATLAS) Visual Basic .NET point cloud viewing and analysis application.

by: Ryan Brazeal
date: April, 2015

This project was created, utilized and re-developed within several geomatics graduate course at the University of Florida.

ATLAS provides a point cloud viewer as well as analysis tools. Specifically the use of inexpensive registration/georeferencing targets (high contrast circles printed using traditional printers as well as 3D printed spheres) are implemented within ATLAS. Also, basic computer vision algorithms were used along with the native GDI+ graphics built into the .NET framework. This allows interested students/readers to learn about how to compute 2D graphics for 3D models (using both perspective and orthographic views).

I apologize as the code is not the prettiest and currently NOT well documented. These will be future aims of this project.

I welcome any and all contributors and feedback/questions.

Thanks,

Ryan
